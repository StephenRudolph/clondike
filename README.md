# clondike

Clondike sets out to solve three deficits with the standard Klondike games available in Windows and Gnome:

* Command-line interface
* All games are guaranteed to be winnable
    * You are notified when the game is no longer winnable
* Cross platform compatible

Clondike is also intended as a platform for analyzing the game of Klondike.

Clondike is written in Clojure, hence the name :).
